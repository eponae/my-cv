## 🚀 Quick start

1.  **Created with Gatsby**

    https://www.gatsbyjs.org/

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into the site’s directory and develop

    ```shell
    cd my-cv/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying the static data._
